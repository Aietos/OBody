# OBody

OBody is a mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition which distributes all installed bodyslide presets randomly to NPCs for greater body variety. It also lets you manually select which bodyslide preset you want for a given NPC or your player character.

This version of OBody contains a DLL file which was compiled with CommonLibSSE NG, meaning that this single DLL file will work on every version of Skyrim, including the Anniversary Edition versions.

For the SKSE C++ source code used to build the DLL file, [click here](https://github.com/Aietos/OBody-NG).
